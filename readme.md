# Accuracy Configurable Approximate Adder
This VHDL project aims to create an accuracy configurable approximate adder (ACA) in six different configurations. * MORE TO BE ADDED*

* **ACA8-2**: bla bla

* **ACA8-4**: bla bla

* **ACA16-2**: bla bla

* **ACA16-4**: bla bla

* **ACA16-8**: bla bla

* **ACA32-2**: Currently not working, but project structure for a possible 32 full adder, with 16 blocks, meaning each block is a 2 bit full adder.

* **ACA32-4**: Currently not working, but project structure for a possible 32 full adder, with 8 blocks, meaning each block is a 4 bit full adder.
